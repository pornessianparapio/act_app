act as an exprt python developer. understand the following problem and give most optimized solution
implement in python
Problem:
Assume a database 'activity_monitor.db' in that there are two tables Activity(activity_name,app_name,no_of_times_app_opened,ip_address,time_entry(fk)) and TimeEntry(first_start_time, start_time, end_time, final_end_time, minutes)
Activity table is connected to TimeEntry table by thr foreign key time_entry. Every entry in activity table has exactly one time entry in TimeEntry table. 


if activity exists in Activity table:
	set endtime of previous acitvity = now
	set final endtime of previous acitvity = now
	set minutes of previous activity += (end_time of previous activity - start_time of previous activity)
	set starttime of current acitvity = now
	set no_of_times_app_opened of current activity +=1

if activity doesnt exist:
	add the new actiivity to activty table
	set first_start_time of this activity= now
	set start_time = now

	

Note:
1. the orm used to query the db is peewee
2. suggest which datastructure or algorithm would you use to solve the problem of previous and current and activity give reasons why.
3. make sure to add comments everywhere for better understanding and documentation
